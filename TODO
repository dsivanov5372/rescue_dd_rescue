Random ideas of future work on dd_rescue and plugins.
=====================================================
* Par2 module to add error correcting Reed-Solomon/Erasure Codes
* ddr_lzo: More de/compression algorithms and file formats (.gz, .xz, lzip)
* Keep track of successfully copied blocks in dd_rescue itself to ease dd_rhelp's job ...
* ddr_hash: More optimization (ARMv8), addition of SHA-3 (and SKEIN?) algs.
* A networking plugin that allows (mostly unprotected?) network copies via TCP.
* Leverage fault injection for more regression tests
* Convert sparse detection into a plugin?
* Reorganize source tree into multiple directories

See CRYPT_TODO for thoughts on the ddr_crypt plugin.
